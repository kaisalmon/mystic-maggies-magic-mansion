> Maggie has a very special house. She's spent the summer journeying across Northern Europe, with her little witch's hut carrying her wherever she wants on it's massive bird-like legs. But there is a coldness in the air. Maggie looks out the her window at the trees and the forests, made damp by light drizzle, she realises that summer has once again given up it's fight against autumn. Soon it will be winter, and her home's avian legs grow tired. She'd been feeling pretty cramped anyway, living in just one room. Once she settles down, with just a few magic spells, she'll be living in a honest-to-the-gods mansion. Maybe winter won't be so bad after all.

A friendly first person adventure game, where you collect items in Maggie's home, combine them in cauldrons to produce magic, and then use that magic to cast spells to expand your home.  This game was created in nine days by a team of three, for the [GWJ#85](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-85). The theme was Expansion, and the three wild cards were: Autumnal, Single Location, and Limited Pallete.
